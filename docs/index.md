# Payment Channels
Bitcore includes classes necessary to handle payment channel smart contracts. The approach taken is networking-agnostic, so this library can be used at any layer.

## Installation
Payment channels are implemented as a separate module and you must add it to your dependencies:

For node projects:

```
npm install bitcore-lib --save
npm install bitcore-channel --save
```

For client-side projects:

```
bower install bitcore-lib --save
bower install bitcore-channel --save
```

## Getting Started
The library has two sides to it: the Consumer and the Provider of the services or goods that are being transacted.

Let's start with an overview of how to use the Consumer side. Let's assume that we know the server's public key and that we have it in a string, encoded in hexa ascii values, in compressed format.

We also have a final address that we'll use as a "change" address (sending here any funds that we didn't transact with the Provider). We'll call this the "refund" address, as it will also be the address where the refund will get to in case the contract is cancelled.

```javascript
var bitcore = require('bitcore-lib');
var Consumer = require('bitcore-channel').Consumer;
var providerPublicKey = '027f10e67bea70f847b3ab92c18776c6a97a78f84def158afc31fd98513d42912e';
var refundAddress = 'mzCXqcsLBerwyoRZzBFQELHaJ1ZtBSxxe6';
var providerAddress = 'mrCHmWgn54hJNty2srFF4XLmkey5GnCv5m';

// Make sure to save this, a good way is to use the bitcore-mnemonic library or
// export a WIF format with fundingKey.toWIF()
var fundingKey = new bitcore.PrivateKey();

var consumer = new Consumer({
  fundingKey: fundingKey,
  network: 'testnet',
  providerPublicKey: providerPublicKey,
  providerAddress: providerAddress,
  refundAddress: refundAddress
});
```

Now that we have instantiated our object, we have two ways of funding the channel. The basic one is to send bitcoins to an address that is provided by the Consumer instance (a private key is created for this purpose).

```javascript
console.info('Send bitcoins to ' + consumer.fundingAddress.toString() ' to fund the channel');

consumer.processFunding([{...}, {...}, {...}]);
```

The objects that the consumer can understand are those returned by the Insight API: [https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api#unspent-outputs](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api#unspent-outputs)

Once funded, we'll need the server to sign the refund transaction that allows us to reclaim our funds in case the server vanishes.

```javascript
var messageToProvider = consumer.setupRefund();
```

Now let's take a look at the Provider side. We'll need to specify a final address where to send our funds.

```javascript
var Provider = require('bitcore-channel').Provider;
var paymentAddress = 'mig4mc6q7PTQ2YZ9ax5YtR4gjARfoqJSZd';

var provider = new Provider({
  network: 'testnet',
  paymentAddress: paymentAddress
});
console.info('Share this public key with potential consumers: ' + provider.getPublicKey());
```

So when we receive a refund transaction from a consumer, we can easily sign it and return it back.

```javascript
var messageToConsumer = provider.signRefund(receivedRefund);
```

As a consumer, we'd like to validate that the refund received is valid. If it is valid, we can start paying the Provider.

```javascript
assert(consumer.validateRefund(messageFromProvider));

sendToProvider(consumer.incrementPaymentBy(400 * SATOSHIS));
sendToProvider(consumer.incrementPaymentBy(4 * BITS));
```

The Provider will like to verify that the transaction is indeed valid and the expected value is being received:

```javascript
assert(provider.validPayment(messageFromConsumer));
assert(provider.currentAmount === 8 * BITS);
```

Of course, he can also interrupt the channel and broadcast the transaction.

```javascript
provider.getPaymentTx();
```
